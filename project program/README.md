# My Python Programming Projects

Welcome to my project folder!  
This repository contains Python programs that I created as part of my **Introduction to Programming** module. These projects helped me practise basic programming concepts and build confidence using Python.

##  About This Folder

The programs in this folder focus on:
- Understanding user input
- Writing clear conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Using loops such as `for` and `while`
- Working with lists, strings, and numbers
- Handling errors and incorrect input

All code is written at a **beginner-friendly level** and follows what was taught in lectures and lab sessions.

## task 1

This program simulates a pizza shop offer where:
- The customer must order **four pizzas**
- The **cheapest pizza is free**
- The program calculates the final total
- The discount percentage is displayed

The program also checks for invalid input such as negative numbers or non-numeric values.

## task 2

This program improves password security by:
- Asking the user to enter a password
- Checking that the password is **at least 9 characters long**
- Randomly asking the user to confirm **three characters** from the password
- Ending immediately if any answer is incorrect

If all checks are passed, access is granted successfully.

##  How to Run the Programs

Make sure Python is installed, then run a file using:

```bash
python filename.py
