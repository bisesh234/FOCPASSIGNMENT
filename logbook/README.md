#  Logbook

Welcome to my **Logbook** folder!  
This section contains notes, reflections, and outputs from my programming journey. I use it to document what I’ve learned, challenges I faced, and solutions I discovered.

Keeping a logbook helps track progress and makes revision easier — especially during lab exercises and assignments.

##  What You’ll Find Here

This folder may include:

- Daily notes from lab sessions
- Summaries of lecture topics
- Code snippets with explanations
- Problem solving steps and examples
- Output screenshots or recordings
- Personal reflections on learning progress

*(Update this section based on what’s actually in your logbook folder!)*

## Why I Use a Logbook

The logbook helps me:

- Understand programming concepts more deeply
- Track my progress over time
- Prepare for assignments and revision
- Remember how I solved tricky problems

This is my personal learning journal, and I update it as I go.
